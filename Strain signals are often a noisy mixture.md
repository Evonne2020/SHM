Strain signals are often a noisy mixture of electrical signals generated from the activities of several different sources from ……. The main issues in the processing of strain signals are the denoising, separation and identification of the signals from different sources.

Noise and distortion fundamentally constrain the measurement accuracy in signal processing and control systems, as well as decision accuracy in pattern recognition [1]. 
Digital signal processing algorithms can be categorized into four broad categories: transform-based signal processing, model-based signal processing, Bayesian statistical signal processing and neural networks [1]. The objective of a transform is to represent a signal or system through a combination of elementary signals (e.g., sinusoids, eigenvectors, or wavelets) that facilitate straightforward analysis, interpretation, and manipulation. Transform-based signal processing techniques encompass methods such as the Fourier transform, Laplace transform, z-transform, and wavelet transforms. Model-based methods employ a parametric model to describe the signal generation process, capturing predictable structures and expected patterns. These models facilitate forecasting future signal values based on past trajectories. However, they are sensitive to deviations from the signal class defined by the model. Bayesian inference theory offers a generalized framework for the statistical processing of random signals. In pattern recognition or signal estimation from noisy observations, Bayesian methods integrate the evidence from the observations with prior knowledge about the signal distributions and associated parameter distributions. Neural networks consist of relatively simple, non-linear, adaptive processing units organized to mimic the signal transmission and processing characteristics of biological neurons. These networks feature multiple layers of parallel processing elements connected through a hierarchically structured network. The connection weights are trained to memorize patterns and execute signal processing functions, such as prediction or classification. Neural networks excel in non-linear partitioning of signal spaces and in feature extraction and pattern recognition. In some hybrid systems, neural networks complement Bayesian inference methods for enhanced pattern recognition.
Noises superposed upon the useful strain signal, may lead to unreliable structural condition assessment or prediction. Consequently, denoising becomes a crucial issue in an efficient SHM of civil structures.
Numerous investigations have been carried out to implement the task of vibration signal denoising in frequency, time, and time-frequency. In the time domain, the synchronous averaging method, is one of the typical and powerful techniques to extract periodic signal components from a compound signal. The main application limitation of the time domain methods is that the effectiveness of denoising may dramatically diminish in a non-stationary noisy context. The widely used Kalman filtering is also an earlier proposed time domain denoising algorithm. The main application limitation of Kalman filtering is that the system model needs to be given manually, and the filtering effect will be degraded with an inaccurate system model. This method is suitable for the situation where the input signal is relatively stationary or the kinematics model of the test system is known. 

The classical frequency domain methods, such as low-pass filters, high-pass filters, band-pass filters, can remove noise depending on the frequency bands between the vibration signal and noise. Consequently, noise in the same frequency band as the signal cannot be filtered by denoising methods. In addition, this approach may easily lead to greater signal distortion. 

Strain signals are of non-linear and non-stationary characteristics. Many effective methods have been developed to solve this problem.
Time-frequency domain methods, which are primarily based on the wavelet transform (WT) and time-frequency analysis (TFA), can take both time and frequency information into account so that the noise in the time–frequency plane can be eradicated. 
Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [2] is a recursive method for processing non-linear and non-stationary signals. Some novel EMD-based denoising techniques inspired by wavelet threshold have been developed. However, the EMD algorithm is susceptible to mode mixing, easily producing oscillations of different scales in one mode, or similar-scale oscillations in different modes [3, 4]. Aiming at the disadvantages of EMD, the improved ensemble EMD (EEMD) and complete ensemble EMD (CEEMD) methods can suppress the mode mixing effectively. But both require multiple iteration calculations, which reduce the denoising efficiency. In contrast to EMD, variational mode decomposition (VMD) proposed in 2014 can adaptively decompose any signal into a group of band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs). Related studies have shown that VMD is superior to EMD in terms of tone detection, separation and denoising [5], but there still exists a problem of EMD-like endpoint effects in decomposition. In addition, singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm, with good stability and invariance, is an effective approach to eliminate random noise and can retain important mutation information of the signals. At present, one of its major drawbacks is that there are no mature and complete methods to select effective singular values. Throughout all the denoising methods suitable for non-linear and non-stationary signals, wavelet filtering which is a more efficient multi-resolution denoising approach. Its fundamental principle is that a threshold rule is applied to shrink the wavelet coefficients, and then the denoised signal is reconstructed by inverse wavelet transform from these shrunken wavelet coefficients [6]. 

And the denoising performance and efficiency rely on the reasonable selection of mother wavelet, decomposition level and threshold. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is constructed by the selected wavelet basis function and its corresponding scaling function, and can be implemented by a pair of low-pass and band-pass filters. The signals decomposed with DWT can avoid redundant information generated by CWT decomposition.

Recently, the development of deep network architectures makes deep learning methods widely applied for denoising in various fields [7]. Deep learning-driven denoising techniques, such as autoencoders, artificial neural networks (ANN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), can model the non-linear relationships between noise and the clean signal by pre-training whereby the redundant information in the new input signal can be filtered accurately. Compared with conventional denoising methods, deep learning-based denoising approaches can be expected to avoid complicated manual setting parameters and handle different tasks without many modifications. 深度学习方法的问题

Strain sensors are usually low-cost and densely distributed on a monitored structure. After long-term operation, there are various noises. Large data volume and real-time structural condition assessment especially requires high computational efficiency.

The crucial matter of each denoising process lies in removing most of the unwanted noise, without losing the useful part of the signal containing the true monitoring information.
The essence of each denoising process is to effectively eliminate the majority of unwanted noise while preserving the useful information.

Several signal denoising techniques have been proposed in the literature, some of which are currently in development. Band-pass filter is the most basic and traditional way to remove noises.
It uses cut-off frequencies which allow to remove all the frequency contents greater or lower than a certain frequency value, respectively. Moving average filters, as well as Gaussian filters, can be considered as typical examples belonging to such a category. However, while filters may be effective when noise occupies a distinct frequency band separate from the signal, they often fail when noise shares a similar frequency spectrum with the target signal. In such cases, significant portions of the useful signal can be inadvertently removed, rendering the filtering approach ineffective. This limitation also represents a major drawback of employing Fourier Transform for denoising purposes. However, in practical scenarios, noise distribution is sometimes non-uniform, necessitating the application of localized denoising techniques.
A further powerful methodology for separating noise out of corrupted data involves the application of a discrete wavelet transform (DWT). In particular, in Dohono [8], a first DWT based approach for denoising one-dimensional signals was provided. Afterwards, Chang et al. [9] introduced an innovative adaptive Wavelet thresholding for image denoising and compression, called BaeyShrink method. Denoising algorithms built on discrete wavelet transform decomposes signals into different frequency resolution levels. Thresholding is then applied to higher frequency components which generally correspond to noise to eliminate this one.
Furthermore, the use of singular value decomposition (SVD) for denoising purposes has also attracted considerable interest.
Finally, a possible alternative approach in enhancing the quality of noise-affected signals may concern the application of a Kalman filter (KF).

Although there has been a lot of progress in the general area of signal denoising, noise removal remains a very challenging problem in real-world communication systems. Denoising algorithms are typically are chosen based on the type of image, as a specific algorithm may work for a given noise but not for another one. hence the importance of careful selection and tuning of denoising algorithms。
